# The task

Complete the aptly named project in the line of "Applied Responsive Web Design Projects": *Build a Product Landing Page*.

Portion of the Responsive Web Design Section of the Beta Curriculum [@FreeCodeCamp](https://beta.freecodecamp.org).

---

The task itself comes accompanied by a considerable amount of requests. 

#### The page should have:

- a `<header>` element with `id="header"`; this portion should itself nest:

  - an image with `id="header-img"`;

  - a `<nav>` element with `id="nav-bar"`; which itself should be home to at least three click-able elements with `class="nav-link"`, directing each toward the respective section of the page.

- a `<video>` element with `id="video"`;

- a `<form>` element with `id="form"`; element which consists of:
  
  - an `<input>` field with `id="email"`, to submit email addresses;
  
  - a submut `<input>` with `id="submit"`, directing toward this static page: *https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit*

#### The layout of the page should also:

- incorporate a navbar always at the top of the viewport;

- make use of at least one media query and one flex container.

Beyond this, the actual design of the page and content of the different sections is free to be completed as wanted.
Even if not required, this is where a bit of extra effort and imagination are added.
